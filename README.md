# EStore
EStore is an Android Native application developed using Android Studio,
MVVM Architecture, and Kotlin that helps
customers fulfill their shopping needs. The app supports two languages at this moment ( English and
Hebrew) and offers a variety of products with their description and price to the user who can choose to add
them to their cart if logged in or register or continue browsing as a guest.

As a guest,
users can still use the app almost like registered users and, browse through the available
products. The app provides detailed information about different products from jewelry to electronics to
men's/ woman's wear , including their price descriptions, and other relevant information to help users make
informed decisions.
